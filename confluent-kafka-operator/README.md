# Kafka Deployment - AWS

A Pulumi program template that deploys the Confluent Operator and its components to the EKS cluster created from the [infrastructure project](https://github.com/wwt/pulumi-templates/tree/master/aws-eks-infra).

#### Deployed Resources:

* Confluent Operator
* 3 Brokers
* 3 Zookeepers
* Schema Registry
* KSQL
* Connect Cluster
* Replicator
* Control Center



### Deploying Kafka

1. Create a new folder:

   ```sh
   mkdir kafka-services && cd kafka-services
   ```

2. Create a new project:

   ```sh
   pulumi new https://github.com/wwt/pulumi-templates/confluent-kafka-operator
   ```

3. Fill out the prompts appropriately. **Note: A Confluent License key is required. Trial key is ok.**

4. Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy the changes. This will only configure the Kubernetes cluster and deploy the operator.

5. Enable and deploy Zookeeper with:

   ```sh
   pulumi config set enableZookeeper true && pulumi update --skip-preview
   ```

6. Wait for all 3 zookeeper pods to be ready then enable and deploy the brokers:

   ```sh
   pulumi config set enableKafka true && pulumi update --skip-preview
   ```

7. Wait for all 3 broker pods to be ready then enable any remaining components you would like to deploy the same way you deployed Zookeeper and the brokers. e.g.

   ```sh
   pulumi config set enableSchemaRegistry true && pulumi update --skip-preview
   ```



### Destroying the Infrastructure

1. Disable all components except for the operator by setting all the config vars for the respective components to `false` (e.g. `pulumi config set enableSchemaRegistry false`) then run `pulumi update --skip-preview`

   * If the brokers stuck in a terminating state, go into your AWS console and detach the remaining EBS volumes. This will allow the brokers to fully terminate. Make sure the `kafka` pods are no longer present before proceeding with the next step.

2. Run `pulumi destroy --skip-preview` to finish tearing down the stack.

3. Remove the stack and its history with:

   ```
   pulumi stack rm dev
   ```
